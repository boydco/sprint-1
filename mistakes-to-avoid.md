Notes:

1. leave room for human error in searches, especially for elderly and those bad at spelling.

2. PDF's ruin the flow and are difficult to navigate. Probably not the best way to make a website accessible.

3. By changing colors of links already visited, it helps users remain oriented within the site and know where they've been and if those pages have provided the information they seek.

4. Write for online, make it scannable, it's a website, not a novel.

5. Keep open the option to resize text. and use text in relative terms so it may vary by device and person's ability to see small or large text.

6. Be succint and 66 characters or less for page titles as they are essentially a first-touch point in SERPs.

7. Looking like, sounding like, or being like an ad is a good way to ruin user engagement.

8. Be consistent within your site and within common web design conventions. People are used to websites being a certain way, more often than not, keep your website consistent with convention in order to have people using the information on it rather than trying to figure out how to use it. AKA Don't make them think.

9. Use 'open a new browser window' sparingly. Pop-ups make people want to jump in a cold ocean during winter.

10. Websites exist to supply users with entertainment or information that they seek. Provide that and you will have visitors.
