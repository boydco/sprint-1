## HTML

I'm really struggling to find something to complain about with your HTML, dang it. You are either very bright or you've done this before. Easily the best example I've seen in a long time.

But, of course, I'm nitpicky, so I would prefer it if you limited line length to 80 characters, which would make this:

```html
<p>
  It's best to use html when you're creating a website or devising
  some exceptional plan.
</p>
```

No need to space between content and tag.

You can do this in the head:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
```

Still more than 80 characters, but sometimes there's nothing you can do.

Ah, but I do have one last trick up my sleeve:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet"
  href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
```

You can leave off the protocol and it will try both. And 79 characters. I rock!


## Empathy

Nice! Glad to see some scepticism. That's good. Hope you stay sceptical.

Overall, outstanding. You're going to do well. Push hard, and we'll try to take you as far as you can go.
